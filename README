Echo with CGO
=============

It's a little bit more complicated `echo` command demonstrating how to write C 
extensions for Go apps using Makefiles to make the package maintainance easier. 
You can install it with:

    $ go install github.com/nu7hatch/cgoecho2

Or build manually:

    $ git clone git://github.com/nu7hatch/cgoecho2.git
    $ cd cgoecho2
    $ make
